        etc. can be expected to result in a 0 on the assignment, a one-half letter grade reduction, a 0 in the course, and/or
        a failing the course with an academic integrity violation. </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Standard University -->

    <h2>Late Work Policy </h2>
    Graded activities are expected to be completed by due date. Late work is not accepted and may result in a 0 for the assignment.
    If you must miss an activity or a deadline, contact the instructor in advance.

    <h2>Submissions</h2>
    All submissions must be unique and creative. All submissions must be your own, creative, unique work. Students may be asked
    to explain their work during class, in discussions, or in a recorded submission.

    <h2> Grade of Incomplete (I)</h2>
    Following Northwest Missouri State University policy, incomplete grades may only be given in extreme circumstances, such
    as illness, death in a student 's immediate family, or similar circumstances beyond a student's control, and the student
    was unable to complete a significant portion of the course work.

    <h2>Attendance </h2>
    Students are expected to attend all classes as specified in the course syllabi for each course. This course has many in-class
    activities, most of which have points and may not be announced in advance. Students arriving late or missing activities
    due to unexcused absences may not be able to make up work and may earn zero points for the activity. It is the responsibility
    of the student to promptly notify their instructor when unable to attend class. Please refer to the university policy
    on attendance at
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf">https://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Attendance.pdf</a>

    <h2>Excused Absences </h2>
    Excused absences include attendance at a university sponsored event (documented with an excuse signed by the university sponsor
    prior to the event) or by circumstances considered extenuating by the course instructor. A student may make up class
    work without penalty for excused absences.

    <h2>Final Exams</h2>
    If an emergency occurs that prevents the administration of a course scheduled final examination, the final course grades
    will be calculated based on the work in the course completed to that point in time and the faculty member’s considered
    judgment. Final exams will not be rescheduled, and a grade of “I” will not be given as a result of an institutional cancellation
    of a final examination.

    <h2>Administrative Drop </h2>
    An instructor may request the Office of the Registrar delete a student from a course roster if the student has not met the
    prerequisite for the course as stated in the catalog, or as a result of non-attendance in the course.

    <h2>Course Access</h2>
    Course content is provided via Canvas and Northwest Online. Access to Northwest Online is at
    <a href="https://nwmissouri.instructure.com/">https://nwmissouri.instructure.com/</a>.

    <h2>University Communications </h2>
    Students are expected to use their Northwest student email account for any electronic correspondence within the university.
    Students are also strongly advised to check their email and CatPAWS accounts on a regular basis.

    <h2>Academic Integrity Policy</h2>
    The students, faculty, and staff at Northwest endeavor to sustain an environment that values honesty in academic work, that
    acknowledges the authorized aid provided by and intellectual contributions of others, and that enables equitable student
    evaluation. Please refer to Northwest Missouri State University’s Academic Integrity Policy at
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Academic-Integrity.pdf">http://www.nwmissouri.edu/policies/academics/Academic-Integrity.pdf </a>. In addition, students are expected to understand
    and abide by the Computer Science and Information Systems Academic Integrity Policy at
    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nwmissouri.edu/csis/pdf/AcademicIntegrityCSI.doc">http://www.nwmissouri.edu/csis/pdf/AcademicIntegrityCSI.doc </a>. This document explains types of behavior considered
    to constitute academic dishonesty. You are responsible for reading this document and abiding by the guidelines described
    therein.

    <h2>Special Accommodations Policy </h2>
    Northwest Missouri State University complies with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities
